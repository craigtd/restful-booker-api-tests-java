#YAML properties for acceptance tests
#spring will use the properties below by default - these are considered
#there are a variety of ways to override these, please see:
#https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html
#the easiest thing is probably to set a command line argument for the properties you wish to override, for example:
#-DauthHeader=myHeader
#to enable these arguments activate the LOCALHOST1 profile -Dspring.profiles.active=LOCALHOST1
